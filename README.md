# Jimâ€™s Perferences.

These are env. preferences to setup a dev. system in the way I like.

## Installation
Copy and paste the following line into your terminal:

    curl https://raw.github.com/jimzhan/.files/master/setup -L -o - | sh

Or manually clone dotfiles and run the installer script:

    git clone https://github.com/jimzhan/.files.git ~/.files
    cd ~/.files
    ./setup

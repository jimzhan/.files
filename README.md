# Jim's dotfiles

These are env. preferences to setup a dev. system in the way I like.

## Installation
Copy and paste the following line into your terminal:

    curl https://raw.github.com/fdietz/dotfiles/master/install.sh -L -o - | sh

Or manually clone dotfiles and run the installer script:

    git clone https://github.com/fdietz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    ./install.sh
